I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC~Berkeley, advised by Professor [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/ Martin Wainwright]. 

Previously,  I obtained my Ph.D. at Princeton University under the supervision of Professor [http://www.princeton.edu/~yc5/ Yuxin Chen] and Professor [https://orfe.princeton.edu/~jqfan/ Jianqing Fan]. I have also worked with Professor [http://magics.cs.northwestern.edu/people.html Han Liu]. Prior to attending Princeton University, I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2015. \n
\n
I am broadly interested in mathematics of data science, machine learning, high-dimensional statistics, convex and nonconvex optimization as well as their applications to neuroscience. \n

I'll be joining the [https://stat.uchicago.edu/ Department of Statistics] as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago in July 2021.
