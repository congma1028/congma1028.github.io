I am an assistant professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago. 



Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at UC~Berkeley, advised by Professor [https://computing.mit.edu/martin-wainwright/ Martin Wainwright]. I obtained my Ph.D. at Princeton University in 2020, advised by Professor [https://yuxinchen2020.github.io/ Yuxin Chen] and Professor [https://orfe.princeton.edu/~jqfan/ Jianqing Fan]. Prior to the graduate school, I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2015. \n
\n
I am broadly interested in mathematics of data science with a current focus on reinforcement learning, transfer learning, multi-modal learning, high-dimensional statistics, and nonconvex optimization. \n
